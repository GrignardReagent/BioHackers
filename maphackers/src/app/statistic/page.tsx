  const question = 'Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of expanding a runway in this area for Heathrow Airport, and also suggest any potential mitigation strategies.';
  const answer_ = `Pros:
Improved Transportation and Connectivity: The new runway will enhance the transportation network, alleviating congestion and increasing international connectivity. It will support greater flight operations, boosting London's position as a global aviation hub.
Economic Growth: The early surge in employment opportunities will benefit construction workers, followed by long-term benefits through aviation-related industries. This will positively impact both residential (15%) and industrial (1%) areas, leading to job creation.
Development Potential: The expansion will boost local infrastructure and business activity, particularly in the residential (15%) and industrial (1%) zones, making the area more economically viable.
Cons:
Environmental Impact: Increased noise levels and air quality (AQI) will have a detrimental effect on both green belts (62%) and waterways (1%). The higher COâ‚‚ emissions will impact biodiversity, with significant risks to the environment as the biodiversity index declines.
Traffic Congestion: The growth of traffic congestion, marked by a sharp increase, will impact residential areas, leading to urban strain, longer commute times, and lower quality of life.
Land Use: Conversion of farmland (21%) and green belts (62%) for expansion may lead to loss of agricultural land and natural habitats, contributing to environmental degradation.
Mitigation Strategies:
Noise and Air Pollution Control: Implement noise barriers and optimize flight paths to minimize disruption to residential and green belt areas. Use sustainable aircraft technologies to reduce emissions.
Ecological Restoration: Protect nearby waterways and green belts, and offset habitat loss with local conservation projects to maintain biodiversity.
Traffic Management: Improve local transport infrastructure, enhance public transport options, and consider congestion pricing to reduce traffic stress.
Community Support: Offer compensation or relocation options to residents in heavily affected areas, especially near noise-prone zones.`;
